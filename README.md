Password Generator

The purpose of this project is to modify starter code in Javascript to create an application that enables a user to generate a random password based on criteria they have selected. 

How it works:

When the user clicks generate password they are prompted to enter a number between 8-128 characters. Once the amount is selected there are 4 confirm windows for the user to select their password criteria. 

Depending on the users choice numbers, symbols, uppercase, lower case will either be included or removed. 

After this the chosen password is shown. 

No errors appear within the console when inspected.
